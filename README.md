# Rajasthan Govt. Accident Reduction - Road Safety

This is a website by Govt. of Rajasthan that uses the aadhar c ard details of a citizen in order to get data about them. Once a citizen is registered, all they need is a single tap to report an accident. The server along with the location & other details send them to all the concenrned authorities. There is very less chance of fake calls as the user is authenticated using aadhar. 

It also provides a phone number service where a user can report just by giving missed call on the given number.
